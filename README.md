# Random Password Generator

## Purpose
To generate a random password based on 5 prompts: character length, and whether 'OK' or 'Cancel' to the inclusion of UPPERCASE letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Basic HTML and CSS styling was provided but the JavaScript file had to be written from scratch.

## This Version
This is the first and probably only version for now.

## Built With
